# SQL Practice Queries 🧠📊

This repository contains SQL queries I’ve written while learning and practicing SQL concepts. The goal is to improve my ability to work with data, write efficient queries, and understand how to explore and manipulate databases using SQL.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

All queries are organized by topic in the `queries/` folder:

- `select_basics.sql` – Basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `joins.sql` – Inner and Left Joins
- `group_by.sql` – Aggregations using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `AVG`
- `subqueries.sql` – Simple subqueries and nested queries

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

These queries were practiced using:
- MySQL 

---



## ✅ What I’m Learning

- Writing clean and readable SQL
- Filtering and sorting data
- Combining tables using joins
- Using subqueries for comparison
- Aggregating and grouping data

---

## 🚀 What's Next

I plan to add:
- Practice with `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`
- Performance tuning with `INDEXES`
- Real project queries using actual datasets

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or fork this for your own learning! 😊
